### CREATE DISTRIBUTION

This command is used to create a new distribution with the specified name. Optionally, you can specify the column types for the distribution using the COLUMN TYPES clause.

```sql
CREATE DISTRIBUTION <distributionID> [COLUMN TYPES types]

where types is a comma-separated list of column types

where type is one of: VARCHAR, INTEGER, INT
```

### DROP DISTRIBUTION

This command is used to drop an existing distribution with the specified name. The CASCADE keyword is optional and indicates that any dependent objects should also be dropped.

```sql
DROP DISTRIBUTION <distribution_name> [CASCADE]
```

### ALTER DISTRIBUTION

This command is used to alter an existing distribution. You can attach one or more relations to the distribution using the ATTACH RELATION clause, or detach a relation from the distribution using the DETACH RELATION clause.

```sql
ALTER DISTRIBUTION <distribution_name> 
[
    ATTACH RELATION <relation_name> [, <relation_name> ...] | 
    DETACH RELATION <relation_name>
]
```

### CREATE KEY RANGE

This command is used to create a new key range. Since the key space is an ordered set, it is enough to specify only one end of the range

```sql
CREATE KEY RANGE [ <keyRangeID> ]
FROM <lowerBound>
ROUTE TO <shardID> 
FOR DISTRIBUTION <distributionID>
```

### DROP KEY RANGE

This command is used to drop an existing key range.

```sql
DROP KEY RANGE <keyRangeID>
```

### MOVE KEY RANGE

This command is used to move an existing key range to a different shard.

```sql
MOVE KEY RANGE <keyRangeID> TO <shardID>
```
### SPLIT KEY RANGE

This command is used to split an existing key range into two separate key ranges.

```sql
SPLIT KEY RANGE <keyRangeID> FROM <keyRangeFromID> BY <border>
```

### UNITE KEY RANGE

This command is used to unite two adjacent key ranges into a single key range.

```sql
UNITE KEY RANGE <keyRangeIDLeft> WITH <keyRangeIDRight>
```

### SHOW

This command is used to retrieve information about a specific entity of SPQR cluster and simple filtering.

```sql
SHOW entity [WHERE where_clause]

where entity is one of databases, routers, pools, shards, backend_connections, key_ranges, clients, status, distributions, version, relations, task_groups, prepared_statements:
```

The`where_clause` is used to filter the results based on specific conditions. It allows you to specify criteria for selecting the information to be shown.

TODO show backend_connections on datum prod

### KILL CLIENT

This command is used to terminate a specific client connection in a SPQR Router.

```sql
KILL CLIENT <client_id>
```
