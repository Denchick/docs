title: 'Limited cross-shard queries'

SPQR router supports limited subset of cross-shard queries. This is made from best-effort logic in a non-disruptive and non-consistent way and is used mainly for testing purposes. Please do not use this feature in your production, cross-shard snapshot will be inconsistent.
