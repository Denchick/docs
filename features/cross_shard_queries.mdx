title: 'Limited cross-shard queries'
---

SPQR router supports limited subset of cross-shard queries. For example, `SELECT * FROM` without `WHERE` clause or DDL commands. This is made from best-effort logic in a non-disruptive and non-consistent way and is used mainly for testing purposes. Please be carefull using this feature in production, cross-shard snapshot will be inconsistent.

You can force disable this feature by adding a TODO in your router config file.
