title: 'Administrative Console'
---

Before you start sharing a PostgreSQL, you need to configure the rules by which the router will decide which of the shards to send each request to.

For this purpose, SPQR has an administrative console. This is an app that works by PostgreSQL protocol and you can connect to it by usual psql. You can find the console port in your config file.

```
âžœ  psql "host=localhost sslmode=disable user=demo dbname=demo port=7432"
SPQR router admin console
Here you can set up your own routing rules
------------------------------------------------
You can find the documentation here
https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/tree/master/docs

psql (14.5 (Homebrew), server console)
Type "help" to get help.

demo=> SHOW shards;
  listing data shards  
-----------------------
 datashard with ID shard1
 datashard with ID shard2
(2 rows)
```

How to configure sharding rules, see Sharding TODO. List of usefull consol commands can be found in TODO.
