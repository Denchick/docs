title: 'Shard'
---

A **shard** contains a subset of sharded data for a sharded cluster. Together, the cluster's shards hold the entire data set for the cluster.

We assume that the shard is a typical PostgreSQL cluster with a master and replicas. The router by default redirect read requests to the replicas and write requests to the master.

SPQR has no control over the operation of shards. All the router needs to know about a shard is how to connect to it and the range of data it contains.
